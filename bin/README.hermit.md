# Installation

Install it with the following commands:
```zsh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cashapp/hermit/releases/download/stable/install.sh | /bin/bash
. ./bin/activate-hermit
```
> **Note**
> This will download and install hermit into `~/bin`. You should add this to your `$PATH` if it isn't already.
It is also recommended to add hermit's [shell integration](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/shell/)
