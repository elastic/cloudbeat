  name: Ensure that the kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    If `kubelet` is running, and if it is using a file-based kubeconfig file, ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file has permissions of `644` or more restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The `kubelet` kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the `kubelet` service in the worker node.
    You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

    It is possible to run `kubelet` with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file.
    In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file.
  audit: |-
    SSH to the worker nodes

    To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status kubelet
    ```
    The output should return `Active: active (running) since..`

    Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate kubeconfig file:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    The output of the above command should return something similar to `--kubeconfig /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig` which is the location of the kubeconfig file.

    Run this command to obtain the kubeconfig file permissions:

    ```
    stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig
    ```
    The output of the above command gives you the kubeconfig file's permissions.

    Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
    node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 <kubeconfig file>
    ```
  impact: None.
