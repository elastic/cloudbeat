  name: Minimize the admission of root containers
  profile_applicability: '* Level 2'
  description: Do not generally permit containers to be run as the root user.
  rationale: |-
    Containers may run as any Linux user.
    Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout.

    Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user.

    There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit root users in a container.


    If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.
  audit: |-
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:

    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```

    For each PSP, check whether running containers as root is enabled:

    ```
    kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.runAsUser.rule}'
    ```

    Verify that there is at least one PSP which returns `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0.
  remediation: |-
    Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the `.spec.runAsUser.rule` is set to either `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0.
  impact: Pods with containers which run as the root user will not be permitted.
  default_value: |
    By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.
