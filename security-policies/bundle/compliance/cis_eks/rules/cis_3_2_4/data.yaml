  name: Ensure that the --read-only-port is secured
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: Disable the read-only port.
  rationale: |-
    The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API.
    Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster.
  audit: |-
    If using a Kubelet configuration file, check that there is an entry for `authentication: anonymous: enabled` set to `0`.

    First, SSH to the relevant node:

    Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate Kubelet config file:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    The output of the above command should return something similar to `--config /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` which is the location of the Kubelet config file.

    Open the Kubelet config file:
    ```
    cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json
    ```

    Verify that the `--read-only-port` argument exists and is set to `0`.

    If the `--read-only-port` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`.
    Check that if there is a `readOnlyPort` entry in the file, it is set to `0`.
  remediation: |-
    If modifying the Kubelet config file, edit the kubelet-config.json file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` and set the below parameter to false

    ```
    readOnlyPort to 0
    ```

    If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf` on each worker node and add the below parameter at the end of the `KUBELET_ARGS` variable string.

    ```
    --read-only-port=0
    ```

    For all three remediations:
    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service and check status

    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart kubelet.service
    systemctl status kubelet -l
    ```
  impact: |-
    Removal of the read-only port will require that any service which made use of it will need to be re-configured to use the main Kubelet API.
