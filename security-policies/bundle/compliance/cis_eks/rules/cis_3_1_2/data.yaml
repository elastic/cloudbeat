  name: Ensure that the kubelet kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    If `kubelet` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubeconfig file is set to `root:root`.
  rationale: |-
    The kubeconfig file for `kubelet` controls various parameters for the `kubelet` service in the worker node.
    You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |-
    SSH to the worker nodes

    To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status kubelet
    ```
    The output should return `Active: active (running) since..`

    Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate kubeconfig file:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    The output of the above command should return something similar to `--kubeconfig /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig` which is the location of the kubeconfig file.

    Run this command to obtain the kubeconfig file ownership:

    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig
    ```

    The output of the above command gives you the kubeconfig file's ownership.
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>
    ```
