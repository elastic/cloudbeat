  name: Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: Do not override node hostnames.
  rationale: |-
    Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver.
    Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics.
    Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs.
  audit: |-
    **Audit Method 1:**

    If using a Kubelet configuration file, check that there is an entry for `--hostname-override` is not set or does not exist.

    First, SSH to the relevant node:

    Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate Kubelet config file:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    The output of the above command should return something similar to `--config /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` which is the location of the Kubelet config file.

    Open the Kubelet config file:
    ```
    cat /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json
    ```

    Verify that `--hostname-override` argument does not exist.

    **Note** This setting is not configurable via the Kubelet config file.
  remediation: |-
    **Remediation Method 1:**

    If modifying the Kubelet config file, edit the kubelet-config.json file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` and set the below parameter to null

    ```json
    "hostname-override"
    ```

    **Remediation Method 2:**

    If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf` on each worker node and add the below parameter at the end of the `KUBELET_ARGS` variable string.

    ```
    --hostname-override
    ```

    **For all remediations:**
    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service and check status

    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart kubelet.service
    systemctl status kubelet -l
    ```
  impact: |-
    Some cloud providers may require this flag to ensure that hostname matches names issued by the cloud provider. In these environments, this recommendation should not apply.
