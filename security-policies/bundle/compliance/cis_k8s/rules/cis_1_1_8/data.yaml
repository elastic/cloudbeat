  name: Ensure that the etcd pod specification file ownership is set to root:root
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership
    is set to `root:root`.
  rationale: |-
    The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node.
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object.
    You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```

    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: >
    By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
