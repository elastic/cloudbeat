  name: Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: Ensure that the `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.
  rationale: |-
    The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kubelet` service in the worker node.
    You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |-
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the <PATH>/<FILENAME> of the kubelet service config file.

    Please set $kubelet_service_config=<PATH><filename> based on the file location on your system 

    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_service_config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```

    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.
