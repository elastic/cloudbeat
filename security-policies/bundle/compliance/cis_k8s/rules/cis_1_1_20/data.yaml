  name: Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI certificate file permissions are set to 644
    or more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that Kubernetes PKI certificate files have permissions of `644`
    or more restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components.
    The permissions on these files should be set to `644` or more restrictive to protect their integrity.
  audit: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.crt
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod -R 644 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.crt
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: >
    By default, the certificates used by Kubernetes are set to have permissions of
    644
