  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Limit the `Node` and `Pod` objects that a kubelet could modify.
  rationale: |-
    Using the `NodeRestriction` plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the `Node` and `Pod` objects that it could modify as defined.
    Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.
  remediation: |-
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure `NodeRestriction` plug-in on kubelets.
    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.

    ```
    --enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,...
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `NodeRestriction` is not set.
