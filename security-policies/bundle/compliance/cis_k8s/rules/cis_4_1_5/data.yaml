  name: Ensure that the --kubeconfig kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 644
    or more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more
    restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node.
    You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |-
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the <PATH>/<FILENAME> of the kubelet config file.

    Please set $kubelet_config=<PATH><filename> based on the file location on your system 

    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_config=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```

    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```

    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `640`.
