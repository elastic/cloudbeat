  name: Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Disable profiling, if not needed.
  rationale: |-
    Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks.
    It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details.
    If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler
    ```

    Verify that the `--profiling` argument is set to `false`.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the Scheduler pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` file on the Control Plane node and set the below parameter.

    ```
    --profiling=false
    ```
  impact: Profiling information would not be available.
  default_value: |
    By default, profiling is enabled.
