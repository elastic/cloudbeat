  name: Ensure that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument is set as appropriate
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Verify kubelet's certificate before establishing connection.
  rationale: |-
    The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality.
    These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint.
    By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--kubelet-certificate-authority` argument exists and is set as appropriate.
  remediation: |-
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup the TLS connection between the apiserver and kubelets.
    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--kubelet-certificate-authority` parameter to the path to the cert file for the certificate authority.

    ```
    --kubelet-certificate-authority=<ca-string>
    ```
  impact: You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--kubelet-certificate-authority` argument is not set.
