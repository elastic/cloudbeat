  name: Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: Ensure that the `kubelet` service file has permissions of `644` or
    more restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kubelet` service in the worker node.
    You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |-
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the <PATH>/<FILENAME> of the kubelet service config file.

    Please set $kubelet_service_config=<PATH><filename> based on the file location on your system 

    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_service_config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```

    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, the `kubelet` service file has permissions of `640`.
