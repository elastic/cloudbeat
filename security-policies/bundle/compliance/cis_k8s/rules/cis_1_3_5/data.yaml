  name: Ensure that the --root-ca-file argument is set as appropriate
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Allow pods to verify the API server's serving certificate before establishing
    connections.
  rationale: |-
    Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must verify the API server's serving certificate.
    Failing to do so could be a subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.

    Providing the root certificate for the API server's serving certificate to the controller manager with the `--root-ca-file` argument allows the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API server.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
    ```

    Verify that the `--root-ca-file` argument exists and is set to a certificate bundle file containing the root certificate for the API server's serving certificate.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--root-ca-file` parameter to the certificate bundle file`.

    ```
    --root-ca-file=<path/to/file>
    ```
  impact: You need to setup and maintain root certificate authority file.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--root-ca-file` is not set.
