  name: Ensure that the API server pod specification file ownership is set to root:root
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that the API server pod specification file ownership is set
    to `root:root`.
  rationale: |-
    The API server pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the API server.
    You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
    ```

    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, the `kube-apiserver.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
