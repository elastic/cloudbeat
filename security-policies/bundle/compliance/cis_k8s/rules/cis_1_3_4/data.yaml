  name: Ensure that the --service-account-private-key-file  argument is set as appropriate
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Explicitly set a service account private key file for service accounts
    on the controller manager.
  rationale: |-
    To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens.
    The private key should be specified to the controller manager with `--service-account-private-key-file` as appropriate.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
    ```

    Verify that the `--service-account-private-key-file` argument is set as appropriate.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--service-account-private-key-file` parameter to the private key file for service accounts.

    ```
    --service-account-private-key-file=<filename>
    ```
  impact: |-
    You would need to securely maintain the key file and rotate the keys based on your organization's key rotation policy.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--service-account-private-key-file` it not set.
