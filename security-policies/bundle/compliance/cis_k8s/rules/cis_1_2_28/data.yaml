  name: Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Setup TLS connection on the API server.
  rationale: |-
    API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit.
    Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic.
    If `--client-ca-file` argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the `client-ca-file` is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and it is set as appropriate.
  remediation: |-
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection on the apiserver.
    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the client certificate authority file.

    ```
    --client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>
    ```
  impact: TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for your Kubernetes
    cluster deployment.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.
