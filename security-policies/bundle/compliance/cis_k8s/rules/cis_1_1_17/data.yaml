  name: Ensure that the controller-manager.conf file permissions are set to 644 or
    more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that the `controller-manager.conf` file has permissions of 644
    or more restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The `controller-manager.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Controller Manager.
    You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `controller-manager.conf` has permissions of `640`.
