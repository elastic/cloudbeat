  name: Ensure that the --kubeconfig kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
  rationale: |-
    The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node.
    You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |-
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the <PATH>/<FILENAME> of the kubelet config file.

    Please set $kubelet_config=<PATH><filename> based on the file location on your system 

    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_config=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```

    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %U %G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```

    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kubelet.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
