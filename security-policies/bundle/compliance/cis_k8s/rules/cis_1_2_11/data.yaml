  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Do not allow all requests.
  rationale: |-
    Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and do not filter any requests.

    The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13.
    Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that if the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set, its value does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and either remove the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter, or set it to a value that does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
  impact: Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would
    be served.
  default_value: |
    `AlwaysAdmit` is not in the list of default admission plugins.
