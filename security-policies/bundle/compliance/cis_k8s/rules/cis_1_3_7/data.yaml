  name: Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure
    addresses.
  rationale: |-
    The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption.
    As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
    ```

    Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1
  remediation: |-
    Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0
