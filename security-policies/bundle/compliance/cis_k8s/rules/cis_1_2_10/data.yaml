  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin EventRateLimit is set
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Limit the rate at which the API server accepts requests.
  rationale: |-
    Using `EventRateLimit` admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice.
    A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable.
    This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall.
    Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept.

    Note: This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `EventRateLimit`.
  remediation: |-
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file.

    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` and set the below parameters.

    ```
    --enable-admission-plugins=...,EventRateLimit,...
    --admission-control-config-file=<path/to/configuration/file>
    ```
  impact: You need to carefully tune in limits as per your environment.
  default_value: |
    By default, `EventRateLimit` is not set.
