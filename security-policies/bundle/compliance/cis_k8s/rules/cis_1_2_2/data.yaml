  name: Ensure that the --token-auth-file parameter is not set
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Do not use token based authentication.
  rationale: |-
    The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver.
    The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver.
    Hence, do not use static token-based authentication.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--token-auth-file` argument does not exist.
  remediation: |-
    Follow the documentation and configure alternate mechanisms for authentication.
    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and remove the `--token-auth-file=<filename>` parameter.
  impact: |-
    You will have to configure and use alternate authentication mechanisms such as certificates. Static token based authentication could not be used.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--token-auth-file` argument is not set.
