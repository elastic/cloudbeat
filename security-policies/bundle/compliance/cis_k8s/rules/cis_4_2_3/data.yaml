  name: Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: Enable Kubelet authentication using certificates.
  rationale: |-
    The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality.
    These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint.
    By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks.
    Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on each node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

    Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and is set to the location of the client certificate authority file.

    If the `--client-ca-file` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that the file sets `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client certificate authority file.
  remediation: |-
    If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client CA file.


    If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.

    ```
    --client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>
    ```

    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service.
    For example:

    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart kubelet.service
    ```
  impact: You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.
