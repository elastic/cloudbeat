  name: Ensure that the kubelet --config configuration file has permissions set to
    644 or more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: |-
    Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument.
    If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |-
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the <PATH>/<FILENAME> of the kubelet config yaml file.

    Please set $kubelet_config_yaml=<PATH><filename> based on the file location on your system 

    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_config_yaml=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

    ```

    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the Audit step)

    ```
    chmod 644 /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: >
    By default, the /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml file as set up by `kubeadm` has
    permissions of 644.
