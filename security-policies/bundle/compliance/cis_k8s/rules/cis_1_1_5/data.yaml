  name: Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file permissions are set to 644
    or more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file has permissions of
    `644` or more restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the Scheduler service in the master node.
    You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kube-scheduler.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
