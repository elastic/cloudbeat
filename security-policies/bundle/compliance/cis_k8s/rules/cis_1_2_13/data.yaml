  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin SecurityContextDeny is set if PodSecurityPolicy
    is not used
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: |-
    The SecurityContextDeny admission controller can be used to deny pods which make use of some SecurityContext fields which could allow for privilege escalation in the cluster.
    This should be used where PodSecurityPolicy is not in place within the cluster.
  rationale: |-
    SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `SecurityContextDeny`, if `PodSecurityPolicy` is not included.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to include `SecurityContextDeny`, unless `PodSecurityPolicy` is already in place.

    ```
    --enable-admission-plugins=...,SecurityContextDeny,...
    ```
  impact: |-
    This admission controller should only be used where Pod Security Policies cannot be used on the cluster, as it can interact poorly with certain Pod Security Policies
  default_value: |
    By default, `SecurityContextDeny` is not set.
