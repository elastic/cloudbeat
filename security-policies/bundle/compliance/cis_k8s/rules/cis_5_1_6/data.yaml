  name: Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: |-
    Service accounts tokens should not be mounted in pods except where the workload running in the pod explicitly needs to communicate with the API server
  rationale: |-
    Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster.

    Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue.
  audit: |-
    Review pod and service account objects in the cluster and ensure that the option below is set, unless the resource explicitly requires this access.

    ```
    automountServiceAccountToken: false
    ```
  remediation: |-
    Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it.
  impact: |-
    Pods mounted without service account tokens will not be able to communicate with the API server, except where the resource is available to unauthenticated principals.
  default_value: |
    By default, all pods get a service account token mounted in them.
