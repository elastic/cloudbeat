  name: Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: Do not override node hostnames.
  rationale: |-
    Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver.
    Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics.
    Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on each node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

    Verify that `--hostname-override` argument does not exist.

    **Note** This setting is not configurable via the Kubelet config file.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and remove the `--hostname-override` argument from the `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service.
    For example:

    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart kubelet.service
    ```
  impact: |-
    Some cloud providers may require this flag to ensure that hostname matches names issued by the cloud provider. In these environments, this recommendation should not apply.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--hostname-override argument` is not set.
