  name: Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Turn on Role Based Access Control.
  rationale: |-
    Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster.
    It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include `RBAC`.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `RBAC`, for example:

    ```
    --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC
    ```
  impact: |-
    When RBAC is enabled you will need to ensure that appropriate RBAC settings (including Roles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings) are configured to allow appropriate access.
  default_value: |
    By default, `RBAC` authorization is not enabled.
