  name: Ensure that the scheduler.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that the `scheduler.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more
    restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The `scheduler.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler.
    You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `scheduler.conf` has permissions of `640`.
