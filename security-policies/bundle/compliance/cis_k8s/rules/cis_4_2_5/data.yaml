  name: Ensure that the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not set to
    0
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Worker Node'
  description: Do not disable timeouts on streaming connections.
  rationale: |-
    Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports.


    **Note:** By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment.
    Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on each node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```

    Verify that the `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` argument is not set to `0`.

    If the argument is not present, and there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, check that it does not set `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to 0.
  remediation: |-
    If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to a value other than 0.


    If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

    ```
    --streaming-connection-idle-timeout=5m
    ```

    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service.
    For example:

    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart kubelet.service
    ```
  impact: Long-lived connections could be interrupted.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours.
