  name: Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.
  rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects.
    This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes.
    It should be owned by `etcd:etcd`.
  audit: |-
    On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep etcd
    ```

    Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above).
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/etcd
    ```

    Verify that the ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.
  remediation: |-
    On the etcd server node, get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument `--data-dir`, from the below command:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep etcd
    ```
    Run the below command (based on the etcd data directory found above).
    For example,
    ```
    chown etcd:etcd /var/lib/etcd
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, etcd data directory ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.
