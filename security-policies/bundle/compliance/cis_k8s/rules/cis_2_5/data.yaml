  name: Ensure that the --peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to true
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: etcd should be configured for peer authentication.
  rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects.
    These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the etcd server node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep etcd
    ```

    Verify that the `--peer-client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`.

    **Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters.
    If you are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.
  remediation: |-
    Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter.

    ```
    --peer-client-cert-auth=true
    ```
  impact: |-
    All peers attempting to communicate with the etcd server will require a valid client certificate for authentication.
  default_value: |
    **Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you
    are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation
    is not applicable. By default, `--peer-client-cert-auth` argument is set to
    `false`.
