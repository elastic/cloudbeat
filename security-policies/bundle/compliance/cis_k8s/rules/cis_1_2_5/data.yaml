    Ensure that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments are set as appropriate
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Enable certificate based kubelet authentication.
  rationale: |-
    The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoints.
    The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously.
    You should set up certificate-based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.
  audit: |-
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```

    Verify that the `--kubelet-client-certificate` and `--kubelet-client-key` arguments exist and they are set as appropriate.
  remediation: |-
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between the apiserver and kubelets.
    Then, edit API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the kubelet client certificate and key parameters as below.

    ```
    --kubelet-client-certificate=<path/to/client-certificate-file>
    --kubelet-client-key=<path/to/client-key-file>
    ```
  impact: You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
  default_value: |
    By default, certificate-based kubelet authentication is not set.
