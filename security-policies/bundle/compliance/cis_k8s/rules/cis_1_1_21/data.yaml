  name: Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that Kubernetes PKI key files have permissions of `600`.
  rationale: |-
    Kubernetes makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of its components.
    The permissions on these files should be set to `600` to protect their integrity and confidentiality.
  audit: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.key
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `600`.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod -R 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.key
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, the keys used by Kubernetes are set to have permissions of 600
