  name: Ensure IAM Users Receive Permissions Only Through Groups
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through IAM policies.
    There are three ways to define policies for a user: 1) Edit the user policy directly, aka an inline, or user, policy; 2) attach a policy directly to a user; 3) add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy.


    Only the third implementation is recommended.
  rationale: |-
    Assigning IAM policy only through groups unifies permissions management to a single, flexible layer consistent with organizational functional roles.
    By unifying permissions management, the likelihood of excessive permissions is reduced.
  audit: |-
    Perform the following to determine if an inline policy is set or a policy is directly attached to users:

    1. Run the following to get a list of IAM users:
    ```
     aws iam list-users --query 'Users[*].UserName' --output text 
    ```
    2. For each user returned, run the following command to determine if any policies are attached to them:
    ```
     aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <iam_user>
     aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <iam_user> 
    ```
    3. If any policies are returned, the user has an inline policy or direct policy attachment.

    Perform the following to create an IAM group and assign a policy to it:

    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
    2. In the navigation pane, click `Groups` and then click `Create New Group` .
    3. In the `Group Name` box, type the name of the group and then click `Next Step` .
    4. In the list of policies, select the check box for each policy that you want to apply to all members of the group. Then click `Next Step` .
    5. Click `Create Group` 

    Perform the following to add a user to a given group:

    6. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
    7. In the navigation pane, click `Groups` 
    8. Select the group to add a user to
    9. Click `Add Users To Group` 
    10. Select the users to be added to the group
    11. Click `Add Users` 

    Perform the following to remove a direct association between a user and policy:

    12. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
    13. In the left navigation pane, click on Users
    14. For each user:
     - Select the user
