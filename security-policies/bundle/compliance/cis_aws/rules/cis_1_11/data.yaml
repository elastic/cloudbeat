  name: Do not setup access keys during initial user setup for all IAM users that
    have a console password
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    AWS console defaults to no check boxes selected when creating a new IAM user.
    When cerating the IAM User credentials you have to determine what type of access they require.


    Programmatic access: The IAM user might need to make API calls, use the AWS CLI, or use the Tools for Windows PowerShell.
    In that case, create an access key (access key ID and a secret access key) for that user.


    AWS Management Console access: If the user needs to access the AWS Management Console, create a password for the user.
  rationale: |-
    Requiring the additional steps be taken by the user for programmatic access after their profile has been created will give a stronger indication of intent that access keys are [a] necessary for their work and [b] once the access key is established on an account that the keys may be in use somewhere in the organization.

    **Note**: Even if it is known the user will need access keys, require them to create the keys themselves or put in a support ticket to have them created as a separate step from user creation.
  audit: |-
    Perform the following to determine if access keys were created upon user creation and are being used and rotated as prescribed:

    **From Console:**

    1. Login to the AWS Management Console
    2. Click `Services` 
    3. Click `IAM` 
    4. Click on a User where column `Password age` and `Access key age` is not set to `None`
    5. Click on `Security credentials` Tab
    6. Compare the user 'Creation time` to the Access Key `Created` date.
    7. For any that match, the key was created during initial user setup.

    - Keys that were created at the same time as the user profile and do not have a last used date should be deleted.
    Refer to the remediation below.

    **From Command Line:**

    8. Run the following command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) to generate a list of all IAM users along with their access keys utilization:
    ```
     aws iam generate-credential-report
    ```
    ```
     aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d | cut -d, -f1,4,9,11,14,16
    ```
    9. The output of this command will produce a table similar to the following:
    ```
    user,password_enabled,access_key_1_active,access_key_1_last_used_date,access_key_2_active,access_key_2_last_used_date
     elise,false,true,2015-04-16T15:14:00+00:00,false,N/A
     brandon,true,true,N/A,false,N/A
     rakesh,false,false,N/A,false,N/A
     helene,false,true,2015-11-18T17:47:00+00:00,false,N/A
     paras,true,true,2016-08-28T12:04:00+00:00,true,2016-03-04T10:11:00+00:00
     anitha,true,true,2016-06-08T11:43:00+00:00,true,N/A 
    ```
    10. For any user having `password_enabled` set to `true` AND `access_key_last_used_date` set to `N/A` refer to the remediation below.
  remediation: |-
    Perform the following to delete access keys that do not pass the audit:

    **From Console:**

    1. Login to the AWS Management Console:
    2. Click `Services` 
    3. Click `IAM` 
    4. Click on `Users` 
    5. Click on `Security Credentials` 
    6. As an Administrator 
     - Click on the X `(Delete)` for keys that were created at the same time as the user profile but have not been used.
    7. As an IAM User
     - Click on the X `(Delete)` for keys that were created at the same time as the user profile but have not been used.

    **From Command Line:**
    ```
    aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id-listed> --user-name <users-name>
    ```
