  name: Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled
  profile_applicability: '* Level 2'
  description: |-
    CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file containing a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to S3.
    These digest files can be used to determine whether a log file was changed, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the log.
    It is recommended that file validation be enabled on all CloudTrails.
  rationale: Enabling log file validation will provide additional integrity checking
    of CloudTrail logs.

    2. Click on `Trails` on the left navigation pane
    3. For Every Trail:
    - Click on a trail via the link in the _Name_ column
    - Under the `General details` section, ensure `Log file validation` is set to `Enabled`
