  name: Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for unauthorized API calls
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.
    It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for unauthorized API calls.
  rationale: |-
    Monitoring unauthorized API calls will help reveal application errors and may reduce time to detect malicious activity.
  audit: |-
    Perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:

    1. Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:

    - List all CloudTrails: `aws cloudtrail describe-trails`

    - Identify Multi region Cloudtrails: `Trails with "IsMultiRegionTrail" set to true`

    - From value associated with "Name":` note `<cloudtrail__name>`

    - From value associated with "CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn" note <cloudtrail_log_group_name>

    Example: for CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn that looks like arn:aws:logs:<region>:<aws_account_number>:log-group:NewGroup:*, <cloudtrail_log_group_name> would be NewGroup

    - Ensure Identified Multi region CloudTrail is active

    `aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <Name of a Multi-region CloudTrail>`

    ensure `IsLogging` is set to `TRUE`

    - Ensure identified Multi-region Cloudtrail captures all Management Events

    `aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <"Name" as shown in describe-trails>`

    Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with `IncludeManagementEvents` set to `true` and `ReadWriteType` set to `All`

    2. Get a list of all associated metric filters for this `<cloudtrail_log_group_name>` that you captured in step 1:

    ```
    aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name "<cloudtrail_log_group_name>"
    ```

    3. Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:

    ```
    "filterPattern": "{ ($.errorCode = *UnauthorizedOperation) || ($.errorCode = AccessDenied*) || ($.sourceIPAddress!=delivery.logs.amazonaws.com) || ($.eventName!=HeadBucket) }",
    ```

    4. Note the "filterName" `<unauthorized_api_calls_metric>` value associated with the `filterPattern` found in step 3.

    5. Get a list of CloudWatch alarms and filter on the `<unauthorized_api_calls_metric>` captured in step 4.

    ```
    aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query "MetricAlarms[?MetricName == `unauthorized_api_calls_metric`]"
    ```

    6. Note the `AlarmActions` value - this will provide the SNS topic ARN value.

    7. Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic

    ```
    aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn> 
    ```
    at least one subscription should have "SubscriptionArn" with valid aws ARN.

    ```
    Example of valid "SubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:sns:<region>:<aws_account_number>:<SnsTopicName>:<SubscriptionID>"
    ```
  remediation: |-
    Perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:

    1. Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for unauthorized API calls and the `<cloudtrail_log_group_name>` taken from audit step 1.
    ```
    aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name "cloudtrail_log_group_name" --filter-name "<unauthorized_api_calls_metric>" --metric-transformations metricName=unauthorized_api_calls_metric,metricNamespace=CISBenchmark,metricValue=1 --filter-pattern "{ ($.errorCode = "*UnauthorizedOperation") || ($.errorCode = "AccessDenied*") || ($.sourceIPAddress!="delivery.logs.amazonaws.com") || ($.eventName!="HeadBucket") }"
    ```

    **Note**: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings.
    Using the same metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.

    2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify
    ```
    aws sns create-topic --name <sns_topic_name>
    ```
    **Note**: you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all monitoring alarms.
    **Note**: Capture the TopicArn displayed when creating the SNS Topic in Step 2.

    3. Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2
    ```
    aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns_topic_arn from step 2> --protocol <protocol_for_sns> --notification-endpoint <sns_subscription_endpoints>
    ```

    **Note**: you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all monitoring alarms.

    4. Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter created in step 1 and an SNS topic created in step 2
    ```
    aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "unauthorized_api_calls_alarm" --metric-name "unauthorized_api_calls_metric" --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --namespace "CISBenchmark" --alarm-actions <sns_topic_arn>
    ```
  impact: |-
    This alert may be triggered by normal read-only console activities that attempt to opportunistically gather optional information, but gracefully fail if they don't have permissions.

    If an excessive number of alerts are being generated then an organization may wish to consider adding read access to the limited IAM user permissions simply to quiet the alerts.

    In some cases doing this may allow the users to actually view some areas of the system - any additional access given should be reviewed for alignment with the original limited IAM user intent.
