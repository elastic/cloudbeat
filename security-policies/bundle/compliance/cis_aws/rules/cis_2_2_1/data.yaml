  name: Ensure EBS Volume Encryption is Enabled in all Regions
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) supports encryption at rest when using the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service.
    While disabled by default, forcing encryption at EBS volume creation is supported.
  rationale: |-
    Encrypting data at rest reduces the likelihood that it is unintentionally exposed and can nullify the impact of disclosure if the encryption remains unbroken.
  audit: |-
    **From Console:**

    1. Login to AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ 
    2. Under `Account attributes`, click `EBS encryption`.
    3. Verify `Always encrypt new EBS volumes` displays `Enabled`.
    4. Review every region in-use.

    **Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.

    **From Command Line:**

    5. Run 
    ```
    aws --region <region> ec2 get-ebs-encryption-by-default
    ```
    6. Verify that `"EbsEncryptionByDefault": true` is displayed.
    7. Review every region in-use.

    **Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.
  remediation: |-
    **From Console:**

    1. Login to AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ 
    2. Under `Account attributes`, click `EBS encryption`.
    3. Click `Manage`.
    4. Click the `Enable` checkbox.
    5. Click `Update EBS encryption`
    6. Repeat for every region requiring the change.

    **Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.

    **From Command Line:**

    7. Run 
    ```
    aws --region <region> ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default
    ```
    8. Verify that `"EbsEncryptionByDefault": true` is displayed.
    9. Repeat every region requiring the change.

    **Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.
  impact: |-
    Losing access or removing the KMS key in use by the EBS volumes will result in no longer being able to access the volumes.
