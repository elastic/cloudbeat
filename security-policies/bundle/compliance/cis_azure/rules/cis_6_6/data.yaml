  name: Ensure that Network Watcher is 'Enabled'
  profile_applicability: '* Level 2'
  description: Enable Network Watcher for Azure subscriptions.
  rationale: |-
    Network diagnostic and visualization tools available with Network Watcher help users understand, diagnose, and gain insights to the network in Azure.
  audit: |-
    **From Azure Portal**

    1. Go to `Network Watcher`
    2. Ensure that the `STATUS` is set to `Enabled`

    **From Azure CLI**

    ```
    az network watcher list
    ```
    This will list all regions where `provisioningState` is `Succeeded`.


    Then run
    ```
    az account list-locations
    ```
    This will list all regions that exist in the subscription.
    Compare this list to the previous one to ensure that for all regions, `provisioningState` is set to `Succeeded`.

    **From PowerShell**

    Get a list of Network Watchers

    ```
    Get-AzNetworkWatcher
    ```

    Make sure each watcher is set with the `ProvisioningState` setting set to `Succeeded` and all `Locations` are set with a watcher.
  remediation: |-
    Opting out of Network Watcher automatic enablement is a permanent change.
    Once you opt-out you cannot opt-in without contacting support.
  impact: |-
    There are additional costs per transaction to run and store network data. For high-volume networks these charges will add up quickly.
