  name: Ensure that 'Unattached disks' are encrypted with 'Customer Managed Key' (CMK)
  profile_applicability: '* Level 2'
  description: Ensure that unattached disks in a subscription are encrypted with a
    Customer Managed Key (CMK).
  rationale: |-
    Managed disks are encrypted by default with Platform-managed keys.
    Using Customer-managed keys may provide an additional level of security or meet an organization's regulatory requirements.
    Encrypting managed disks ensures that its entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads.

    Even if the disk is not attached to any of the VMs, there is always a risk where a compromised user account with administrative access to VM service can mount/attach these data disks, which may lead to sensitive information disclosure and tampering.
  audit: |-
    **From Azure Portal**

    1. Go to `Disks`
    2. Click on `Add Filter`
    3. In the `filter` field select `Disk state`
    4. In the `Value` field select `Unattached`
    5. Click `Apply`
    6. for each disk listed ensure that `Encryption type` in the `encryption` blade is `Encryption at-rest with a customer-managed key'

    **From Azure CLI**

    Ensure command below does not return any output.
    ```
    az disk list --query '[? diskstate == `Unattached`].{encryptionSettings: encryptionSettings, name: name}' -o json
    ```
    Sample Output:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "encryptionSettings": null,
            "name": "<Disk1>"
        },
        {
            "encryptionSettings": null,
            "name": "<Disk2>"
        }
    ]
    ```
  remediation: |-
    If data stored in the disk is no longer useful, refer to Azure documentation to delete unattached data disks at:

    ```
    -https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/disks/delete
    -https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/disk?view=azure-cli-latest#az-disk-delete
    ```

    If data stored in the disk is important, To encrypt the disk refer azure documentation at:

    ```
    -https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-customer-managed-keys-portal
    -https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/compute/disks/update#encryptionsettings
    ```
  impact: |-
    **NOTE:** You must have your key vault set up to utilize this.
    Encryption is available only on Standard tier VMs. This might cost you more.

    Utilizing and maintaining Customer-managed keys will require additional work to create, protect, and rotate keys.
