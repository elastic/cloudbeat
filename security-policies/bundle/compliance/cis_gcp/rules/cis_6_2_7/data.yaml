    Ensure That the ‘Log_min_duration_statement’ Database Flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL Instance Is Set to ‘-1′ (Disabled)
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    The `log_min_duration_statement` flag defines the minimum amount of execution time of a statement in milliseconds where the total duration of the statement is logged.
    Ensure that `log_min_duration_statement` is disabled, i.e., a value of `-1` is set.
  rationale: |-
    Logging SQL statements may include sensitive information that should not be recorded in logs.
    This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
    2. Select the instance to open its `Instance Overview` page.
    3. Go to the `Configuration` card.
    4. Under `Database flags`, check that the value of `log_min_duration_statement` flag is set to `-1`.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    5. Use the below command for every Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database instance to verify the value of `log_min_duration_statement` is set to `-1`.
    ```
    gcloud sql instances list --format=json| jq '.settings.databaseFlags[] | select(.name=="log_min_duration_statement")|.value'
    ```

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
    2. Select the PostgreSQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled.
    3. Click `Edit`.
    4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section.
    5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `Add item`, choose the flag `log_min_duration_statement` from the drop-down menu and set a value of `-1`.
    6. Click `Save`.
    7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the Overview page.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    8. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command:
    ```
    gcloud sql instances list
    ```
    9. Configure the `log_min_duration_statement` flag for every Cloud SQL PosgreSQL database instance using the below command:
    ```
    gcloud sql instances patch <INSTANCE_NAME> --database-flags log_min_duration_statement=-1
    ```
    ```
    Note: This command will overwrite all database flags previously set.
    To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value.
    For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign ("=").
    ```
  impact: |-
    Turning on logging will increase the required storage over time. Mismanaged logs may cause your storage costs to increase. Setting custom flags via command line on certain instances will cause all omitted flags to be reset to defaults. This may cause you to lose custom flags and could result in unforeseen complications or instance restarts. Because of this, it is recommended you apply these flags changes during a period of low usage.
