  name: Ensure That the ‘Log_disconnections’ Database Flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL
    Instance Is Set to ‘On’
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    Enabling the `log_disconnections` setting logs the end of each session, including the session duration.
  rationale: |-
    PostgreSQL does not log session details such as duration and session end by default.
    Enabling the `log_disconnections` setting will create log entries at the end of each session which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and determine any unusual activity across a time period.
    The `log_disconnections` and `log_connections` work hand in hand and generally, the pair would be enabled/disabled together.
    This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
    2. Select the instance to open its `Instance Overview` page
    3. Go to the `Configuration` card.
    4. Under `Database flags`, check the value of `log_disconnections` flag is configured as expected.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    5. Ensure the below command returns `on` for every Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database instance:
    ```
    gcloud sql instances list --format=json | jq '.[].settings.databaseFlags[] | select(.name=="log_disconnections")|.value'
    ```

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
    2. Select the PostgreSQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled.
    3. Click `Edit`.
    4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section.
    5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `Add item`, choose the flag `log_disconnections` from the drop-down menu and set the value as `on`.
    6. Click `Save`.
    7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the Overview page.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    8. Configure the `log_disconnections` database flag for every Cloud SQL PosgreSQL database instance using the below command:
    ```
    gcloud sql instances patch <INSTANCE_NAME> --database-flags log_disconnections=on
    ```
    ```
    Note: This command will overwrite all previously set database flags.
    To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value.
    For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign ("=").
    ```
  impact: |-
    Turning on logging will increase the required storage over time. Mismanaged logs may cause your storage costs to increase. Setting custom flags via command line on certain instances will cause all omitted flags to be reset to defaults. This may cause you to lose custom flags and could result in unforeseen complications or instance restarts. Because of this, it is recommended you apply these flags changes during a period of low usage.
