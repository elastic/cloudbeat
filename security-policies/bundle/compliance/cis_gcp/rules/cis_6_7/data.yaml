  name: Ensure That Cloud SQL Database Instances Are Configured With Automated Backups
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: It is recommended to have all SQL database instances set to enable
    automated backups.
  rationale: |-
    Backups provide a way to restore a Cloud SQL instance to recover lost data or recover from a problem with that instance.
    Automated backups need to be set for any instance that contains data that should be protected from loss or damage.
    This recommendation is applicable for SQL Server, PostgreSql, MySql generation 1 and MySql generation 2 instances.

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
    2. Click the instance name to open its instance details page.
    3. Go to the `Backups` menu.
    4. Ensure that `Automated backups` is set to `Enabled` and `Backup time` is mentioned.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    5. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command:
    ```
    gcloud sql instances list
    ```

    6. Ensure that the below command returns `True` for every Cloud SQL database instance.
    ```
    gcloud sql instances describe <INSTANCE_NAME> --format="value('Enabled':settings.backupConfiguration.enabled)"
    ```

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
    2. Select the instance where the backups need to be configured.
    3. Click `Edit`.
    4. In the `Backups` section, check `Enable automated backups', and choose a backup window.
    5. Click `Save`.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    6. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command:
    ```
    gcloud sql instances list
    ```

    7. Enable `Automated backups` for every Cloud SQL database instance using the below command:
    ```
    gcloud sql instances patch <INSTANCE_NAME> --backup-start-time <[HH:MM]>
    ```
    The `backup-start-time` parameter is specified in 24-hour time, in the UTCÂ±00 time zone, and specifies the start of a 4-hour backup window.
    Backups can start any time during the backup window.
  impact: Automated Backups will increase required size of storage and costs associated
    with it.
