  name: Ensure KMS Encryption Keys Are Rotated Within a Period of 90 Days
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    Google Cloud Key Management Service stores cryptographic keys in a hierarchical structure designed for useful and elegant access control management.


    The format for the rotation schedule depends on the client library that is used.
    For the gcloud command-line tool, the next rotation time must be in `ISO` or `RFC3339` format, and the rotation period must be in the form `INTEGER[UNIT]`, where units can be one of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).
  rationale: |-
    Set a key rotation period and starting time.
    A key can be created with a specified `rotation period`, which is the time between when new key versions are generated automatically.
    A key can also be created with a specified next rotation time.
    A key is a named object representing a `cryptographic key` used for a specific purpose.
    The key material, the actual bits used for `encryption`, can change over time as new key versions are created.

    A key is used to protect some `corpus of data`.
    A collection of files could be encrypted with the same key and people with `decrypt` permissions on that key would be able to decrypt those files.
    Therefore, it's necessary to make sure the `rotation period` is set to a specific time.

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to `Cryptographic Keys` by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms).
    2. Click on each key ring, then ensure each key in the keyring has `Next Rotation` set for less than 90 days from the current date.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    3. Ensure rotation is scheduled by `ROTATION_PERIOD` and `NEXT_ROTATION_TIME` for each key :

    ```
    gcloud kms keys list --keyring=<KEY_RING> --location=<LOCATION> --format=json'(rotationPeriod)'
    ```

    Ensure outcome values for `rotationPeriod` and `nextRotationTime` satisfy the below criteria:

    `rotationPeriod is <= 129600m` 
    `rotationPeriod is <= 7776000s` 
    `rotationPeriod is <= 2160h` 
    `rotationPeriod is <= 90d` 
    `nextRotationTime is <= 90days` from current DATE

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to `Cryptographic Keys` by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/kms).
    2. Click on the specific key ring
    3. From the list of keys, choose the specific key and Click on `Right side pop up the blade (3 dots)`.
    4. Click on `Edit rotation period`.
    5. On the pop-up window, `Select a new rotation period` in days which should be less than 90 and then choose `Starting on` date (date from which the rotation period begins).

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    6. Update and schedule rotation by `ROTATION_PERIOD` and `NEXT_ROTATION_TIME` for each key:

    ```
    gcloud kms keys update new --keyring=KEY_RING --location=LOCATION --next-rotation-time=NEXT_ROTATION_TIME --rotation-period=ROTATION_PERIOD
    ```
  impact: |-
    After a successful key rotation, the older key version is required in order to decrypt the data encrypted by that previous key version.
