    Ensure That Instances Are Not Configured To Use the Default Service Account With Full Access to All Cloud APIs
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    To support principle of least privileges and prevent potential privilege escalation it is recommended that instances are not assigned to default service account `Compute Engine default service account` with Scope `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`.
  rationale: |-
    Along with ability to optionally create, manage and use user managed custom service accounts, Google Compute Engine provides default service account `Compute Engine default service account` for an instances to access necessary cloud services.
    `Project Editor` role is assigned to `Compute Engine default service account` hence, This service account has almost all capabilities over all cloud services except billing.
    However, when `Compute Engine default service account` assigned to an instance it can operate in 3 scopes.

    ```
    1. Allow default access: Allows only minimum access required to run an Instance (Least Privileges)

    2. Allow full access to all Cloud APIs: Allow full access to all the cloud APIs/Services (Too much access)

    3. Set access for each API: Allows Instance administrator to choose only those APIs that are needed to perform specific business functionality expected by instance
    ```

    When an instance is configured with `Compute Engine default service account` with Scope `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`, based on IAM roles assigned to the user(s) accessing Instance, it may allow user to perform cloud operations/API calls that user is not supposed to perform leading to successful privilege escalation.

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the `VM instances` page by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).
    2. Click on each instance name to go to its `VM instance details` page.
    3. Under the `API and identity management`, ensure that `Cloud API access scopes` is not set to `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    4. List the instances in your project and get details on each instance:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances list --format=json | jq -r '.
    | "SA Scopes: \(.[].serviceAccounts[].scopes) Name: \(.[].name) Email: \(.[].serviceAccounts[].email)"'
    ```
    5. Ensure that the service account section has an email that does not match the pattern `[PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.

    **Exception:**
    VMs created by GKE should be excluded.
    These VMs have names that start with `gke-` and are labeled `goog-gke-node

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the `VM instances` page by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).

    2. Click on the impacted VM instance.

    3. If the instance is not stopped, click the `Stop` button. Wait for the instance to be stopped.

    4. Next, click the `Edit` button.

    5. Scroll down to the `Service Account` section.

    6. Select a different service account or ensure that `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs` is not selected.

    7. Click the `Save` button to save your changes and then click `START`.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    8. Stop the instance:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances stop <INSTANCE_NAME>
    ```
    9. Update the instance:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances set-service-account <INSTANCE_NAME> --service-account=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT> --scopes [SCOPE1, SCOPE2...]
    ```
    10. Restart the instance:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances start <INSTANCE_NAME>
    ```
  impact: In order to change service account or scope for an instance, it needs to
    be stopped.
