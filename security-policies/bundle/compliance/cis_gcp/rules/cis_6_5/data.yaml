  name: Ensure That Cloud SQL Database Instances Do Not Implicitly Whitelist All Public
    IP Addresses
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    Database Server should accept connections only from trusted Network(s)/IP(s) and restrict access from public IP addresses.
  rationale: |-
    To minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be white-listed to connect to it.

    An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to `0.0.0.0/0` which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world.
    Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).
    2. Click the instance name to open its `Instance details` page.
    3. Under the `Configuration` section click `Edit configurations`
    4. Under `Configuration options` expand the `Connectivity` section.
    5. Ensure that no authorized network is configured to allow `0.0.0.0/0`.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    6. Get detailed configuration for every Cloud SQL database instance.

    ```
    gcloud sql instances list --format=json
    ```

    Ensure that the section `settings: ipConfiguration : authorizedNetworks` does not have any parameter `value` containing `0.0.0.0/0`.

    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances).

    2. Click the instance name to open its `Instance details` page.
    3. Under the `Configuration` section click `Edit configurations`
    4. Under `Configuration options` expand the `Connectivity` section.
    5. Click the `delete` icon for the authorized network `0.0.0.0/0`.
    6. Click `Save` to update the instance.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    Update the authorized network list by dropping off any addresses.

    ```
    gcloud sql instances patch <INSTANCE_NAME> --authorized-networks=IP_ADDR1,IP_ADDR2...
    ```

    **Prevention:**

    To prevent new SQL instances from being configured to accept incoming connections from any IP addresses, set up a `Restrict Authorized Networks on Cloud SQL instances` Organization Policy at: [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictAuthorizedNetworks](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictAuthorizedNetworks).
  impact: The Cloud SQL database instance would not be available to public IP addresses.
