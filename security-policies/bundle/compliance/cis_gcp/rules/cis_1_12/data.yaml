  name: Ensure API Keys Only Exist for Active Services
  profile_applicability: '* Level 2'
  description: |-
    API Keys should only be used for services in cases where other authentication methods are unavailable.
    Unused keys with their permissions in tact may still exist within a project.
    Keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key resides.
    It is recommended to use standard authentication flow instead.
  rationale: |-
    To avoid the security risk in using API keys, it is recommended to use standard authentication flow instead.
    Security risks involved in using API-Keys appear below:

    - API keys are simple encrypted strings

    - API keys do not identify the user or the application making the API request

    - API keys are typically accessible to clients, making it easy to discover and steal an API key
  audit: |-
    **From Console:**

    1. From within the Project you wish to audit Go to `APIs & Services\Credentials`. 

    2. In the section `API Keys`, no API key should be listed.

    **From Google Cloud Command Line**

    3. Run the following from within the project you wish to audit **`gcloud services api-keys list --filter`**.

    4. There should be no keys listed at the project level.
  remediation: |-
    **From Console:**

    1. Go to `APIs & Services\Credentials` using

    2. In the section `API Keys`, to delete API Keys: Click the `Delete Bin Icon` in front of every `API Key Name`.

    **From Google Cloud Command Line**

    3. Run the following from within the project you wish to audit **`gcloud services api-keys list --filter`**

    4. **Pipe the results into ** 
    ``gcloud alpha services api-keys delete``
  impact: Deleting an API key will break dependent applications (if any).
