  name: Ensure That BigQuery Datasets Are Not Anonymously or Publicly Accessible
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1'
  description: |-
    It is recommended that the IAM policy on BigQuery datasets does not allow anonymous and/or public access.
  rationale: |-
    Granting permissions to `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers` allows anyone to access the dataset.
    Such access might not be desirable if sensitive data is being stored in the dataset.
    Therefore, ensure that anonymous and/or public access to a dataset is not allowed.
  audit: |-
    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to `BigQuery` by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
    2. Select a dataset from `Resources`.
    3. Click `SHARING` near the right side of the window and select `Permissions`.
    4. Validate that none of the attached roles contain `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    List the name of all datasets.
    ```
    bq ls
    ```
    Retrieve each dataset details using the following command:
    ```
    bq show PROJECT_ID:DATASET_NAME
    ```
    Ensure that `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` have not been granted access to the dataset.
  remediation: |-
    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to `BigQuery` by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).
    2. Select the dataset from 'Resources'.
    3. Click `SHARING` near the right side of the window and select `Permissions`.
    4. Review each attached role.
    5. Click the delete icon for each member `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`. On the popup click `Remove`.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    List the name of all datasets.
    ```
    bq ls
    ```
    Retrieve the data set details: 
    ```
    bq show --format=prettyjson PROJECT_ID:DATASET_NAME > PATH_TO_FILE
    ```
    In the access section of the JSON file, update the dataset information to remove all roles containing `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`.

    Update the dataset:
    ```
    bq update --source PATH_TO_FILE PROJECT_ID:DATASET_NAME
    ```

    **Prevention:**

    You can prevent Bigquery dataset from becoming publicly accessible by setting up the `Domain restricted sharing` organization policy at: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/iam-allowedPolicyMemberDomains .
  impact: |-
    The dataset is not publicly accessible. Explicit modification of IAM privileges would be necessary to make them publicly accessible.
