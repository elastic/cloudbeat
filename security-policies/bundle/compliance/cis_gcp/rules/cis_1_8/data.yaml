  name: Ensure That Separation of Duties Is Enforced While Assigning Service Account
    Related Roles to Users
  profile_applicability: '* Level 2'
  description: |-
    It is recommended that the principle of 'Separation of Duties' is enforced while assigning service-account related roles to users.
  rationale: |-
    The built-in/predefined IAM role `Service Account admin` allows the user/identity to create, delete, and manage service account(s).
    The built-in/predefined IAM role `Service Account User` allows the user/identity (with adequate privileges on Compute and App Engine) to assign service account(s) to Apps/Compute Instances.

    Separation of duties is the concept of ensuring that one individual does not have all necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action.
    In Cloud IAM - service accounts, this could be an action such as using a service account to access resources that user should not normally have access to.

    Separation of duties is a business control typically used in larger organizations, meant to help avoid security or privacy incidents and errors.
    It is considered best practice.

    No user should have `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User` roles assigned at the same time.
  audit: |-
    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to `IAM & Admin/IAM` using `https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam`.

    2. Ensure no member has the roles `Service Account Admin` and `Service account User` assigned together.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    3. List all users and role assignments:

    ```
    gcloud projects get-iam-policy [Project_ID] --format json | \
     jq -r '[
     (["Service_Account_Admin_and_User"] | (., map(length*"-"))), 
     (
     [
     .bindings[] | 
     select(.role == "roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin" or .role == "roles/iam.serviceAccountUser").members[]
     ] | 
     group_by(.) | 
     map({User: ., Count: length}) | 
     .[] | 
     select(.Count == 2).User | 
     unique
     )
     ] | 
     .[] | 
     @tsv'
    ```

    4. All common users listed under `Service_Account_Admin_and_User` are assigned both the `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` and `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` roles.
  remediation: |-
    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. Go to `IAM & Admin/IAM` using `https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam`.

    2. For any member having both `Service Account Admin` and `Service account User` roles granted/assigned, click the `Delete Bin` icon to remove either role from the member.
    Removal of a role should be done based on the business requirements.
  impact: The removed role should be assigned to a different user based on business
    needs.
