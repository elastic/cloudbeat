    **From Google Cloud Console**

    1. From Google Cloud home open the Navigation Menu in the top left.

    2. Under the `Networking` heading select `Network services`.

    3. Select the HTTPS load-balancer you wish to audit.

    4. Select `Edit` then `Backend Configuration`. 

    5. Select `Edit` on the corresponding backend service.

    6. Ensure that `Enable Logging` is selected. Also ensure that `Sample Rate` is set to an appropriate level for your needs.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    7. Run the following command

    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services describe <serviceName>
    ```

    8. Ensure that ```enable-logging``` is enabled and ```sample rate``` is set to your desired level.

    5. Select `Edit` on the corresponding backend service.

    6. Click `Enable Logging`.

    7. Set `Sample Rate` to a desired value. This is a percentage as a decimal point. 1.0 is 100%.

    **From Google Cloud CLI**

    8. Run the following command

    ```
    gcloud compute backend-services update <serviceName> --region=REGION --enable-logging --logging-sample-rate=<percentageAsADecimal>
    ```
  impact: |-
    On high use systems with a high percentage sample rate, the logging file may grow to high capacity in a short amount of time. Ensure that the sample rate is set appropriately so that storage costs are not exorbitant.
