# Cloudbeat

Cloudbeat is a tool that analyzes cloud assets for security compliance and sends findings to Elasticsearch.
It is designed to be used as part of the [Cloud Security](https://www.elastic.co/blog/secure-your-cloud-with-elastic-security) plugin in Kibana.


### CSP Security Policies

Cloudbeat uses security policies from the [Security Policies](./security-policies) directory to evaluate cloud resources.

## Getting Started

To get started with Cloud Security on your cluster, please refer to our documentation:

- [Get started with Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/get-started-with-kspm.html#get-started-with-kspm)

- [Get started with Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/cspm-get-started.html#cspm-get-started)

- [Get started with Cloud Native Vulnerability Management (CNVM)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/master/vuln-management-overview.html)

---

## Deployment

To run Cloudbeat, you need to have Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, etc) running (locally/cloud). See our [Elastic Stack Deployment options](dev-docs/ELK-Deployment.md) documentation.

Once your Elastic Stack is deployed, you can proceed with the deployment of Cloudbeat. For deployment instructions, see [Cloudbeat Deployment options](dev-docs/Cloudbeat-Deployment.md).

## Development

### Prerequisites

We use [Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/usage/get-started/) to manage our development tooling. Please refer to our [README](/bin/README.hermit.md) for detailed instructions on setting it up.
