  name: Ensure that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0 (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not bind to insecure port.
  rationale: >
    Setting up the apiserver to serve on an insecure port would allow
    unauthenticated and unencrypted access to your master node. This would allow
    attackers who could access this port, to easily take control of the cluster.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--insecure-port` argument is set to `0`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the master node and set the below parameter.
    ```
    --insecure-port=0
    ```
  impact: |
    All components that use the API must connect via the secured port,
    authenticate themselves, and be authorized to use the API. This includes: 
    * kube-controller-manager 
    * kube-proxy 
    * kube-scheduler 
    * kubelets
  default_value: |
    By default, the insecure port is set to 8080.
