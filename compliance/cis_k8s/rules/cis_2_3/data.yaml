  name: Ensure that the --auto-tls argument is not set to true (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not use self-signed certificates for TLS.
  rationale: >
    etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments
    for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are
    sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients.
    You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure
    the access to the etcd service.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the etcd server node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep etcd
    ```
    Verify that if the `--auto-tls` argument exists, it is not set to `true`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`
    on
    the control plane
    node and either remove the `--auto-tls` parameter or set it to `false`.
    ```
    --auto-tls=false
    ```
  impact: |
    Clients will not be able to use self-signed certificates for TLS.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--auto-tls` is set to `false`.
