  name: Ensure that the --token-auth-file parameter is not set (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not use token based authentication.
  rationale: >
    The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate
    requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on
    the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the
    apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--token-auth-file` argument does not exist.
  remediation: |
    Follow the documentation and configure alternate mechanisms for
    authentication. Then,
    edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and remove the `--token-auth-file=<filename>`
    parameter.
  impact: >
    You will have to configure and use alternate authentication mechanisms such
    as
    certificates. Static token based authentication could not be used.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--token-auth-file` argument is not set.
