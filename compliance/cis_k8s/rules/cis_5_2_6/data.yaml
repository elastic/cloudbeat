  name: Minimize the admission of containers with allowPrivilegeEscalation (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Do not generally permit containers to be run with the
    `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to true.
    Allowing this right can lead to a process running a container getting more rights 
    than it started with. 
    It's important to note that these rights are still constrained by the overall container 
    sandbox, and this setting does not relate to the use of privileged containers.
  rationale: >
    A container running with the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to `true`
    may have processes that can gain more privileges than their parent. There
    should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit
    containers to allow privilege escalation. The option exists (and is
    defaulted to true) to permit setuid binaries to run. If you have need to run
    containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation, this
    should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check 
    to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given
    permission to use that policy.
  audit: |
    List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy disallows 
    the admission of containers which allow privilege escalation.
  remediation: |
    Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the 
    admission of conatiners with `.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation` set to `true`.
  impact: >
    Pods defined with `spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` will not be
    permitted unless they are run under a specific policy.
  default_value: |
    By default, there are no restrictions on contained process ability to escalate privileges, 
    within the context of the container.
