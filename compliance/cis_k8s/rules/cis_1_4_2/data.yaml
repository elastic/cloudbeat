  name: Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not bind the scheduler service to non-loopback insecure addresses.
  rationale: >
    The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used
    for health and metrics information and is available without authentication
    or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to
    minimize the cluster's attack surface
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler
    ```
    Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1
  remediation: |
    Edit the Scheduler pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address`
    parameter
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0
