  name: Ensure that the --etcd-cafile argument is set as appropriate (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    • Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    etcd should be configured to make use of TLS encryption for client
    connections.
  rationale: >
    etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments
    for persistent
    storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be
    protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd
    server using a SSL Certificate Authority file.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--etcd-cafile` argument exists and it is set as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between
    the apiserver and etcd. Then, edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the etcd
    certificate authority file parameter.
    ```
    --etcd-cafile=<path/to/ca-file>
    ```
  impact: |
    TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for etcd.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--etcd-cafile` is not set.
