  name: Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more
    restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the `admin.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more
    restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The `admin.conf` is the administrator kubeconfig file defining various
    settings for the administration of the cluster. You should restrict its file
    permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be
    writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None.
  default_value: |
    By default, `admin.conf` has permissions of `640`.
