  name: Ensure that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as
    appropriate (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Retain 10 or an appropriate number of old log files.
  rationale: >
    Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files
    ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out
    any investigation or correlation. For example, if you have set file size of
    100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate
    have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--audit-log-maxbackup` argument is set to `10` or as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the `--audit-log-maxbackup` parameter to 10
    or to an appropriate value.
    ```
    --audit-log-maxbackup=10
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, auditing is not enabled.
