  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin SecurityContextDeny is set if PodSecurityPolicy is not used (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    • Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    The `SecurityContextDeny` admission controller can be used to deny pods which make use of

    some SecurityContext fields which could allow for privilege escalation in the cluster. 
    
    This should be used where PodSecurityPolicy is not in place within the cluster.
  rationale: >
    `SecurityContextDeny` can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not

    have PodSecurityPolicies enabled.
  audit: >
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:
      
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    
    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes

    `SecurityContextDeny`, if `PodSecurityPolicy` is not included.
  remediation: >
    Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    
    on the Control Plane node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to include `SecurityContextDeny`, 
    
    unless `PodSecurityPolicy` is already in place.

    `--enable-admission-plugins=...,SecurityContextDeny,...`
  impact: >
    This admission controller should only be used where Pod Security Policies
    cannot be used

    on the cluster, as it can interact poorly with certain Pod Security Policies
  default_value: |
    By default, `SecurityContextDeny` is not set.
