  name: Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 644 or more
    restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Worker Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the `kubelet` service file has permissions of `644` or more
    restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior
    of the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should restrict its file
    permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be
    writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a
    variable
    for the / of
    the kubelet service config file.
    Please set $kubelet_service_config= based on the file location on your system
    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_service_config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
    node. For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    each
    worker
    node. For example,
    ```
    chmod 755 /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, the `kubelet` service file has permissions of `640`.
