    Ensure that the etcd pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or
    more restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions
    of `644` or more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`
    controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in
    the master node. etcd is a highly- available key-value store which
    Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You
    should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: >
    By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of
    `640`.
