  name: Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root
    (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Worker Node
  description: |
    Ensure that the `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The `kubelet` service file controls various parameters that set the behavior
    of the `kubelet` service in the worker node. You should set its file
    ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by
    `root:root`.
  audit: |
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a
    variable
    for the / of
    the kubelet service config file.
    Please set $kubelet_service_config= based on the file location on your system
    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_service_config=/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
    node. For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    each
    worker
    node. For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kubelet` service file ownership is set to `root:root`.
