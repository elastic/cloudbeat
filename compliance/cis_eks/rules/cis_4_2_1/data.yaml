  name: Minimize the admission of privileged containers (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1
  description: |
    Do not generally permit containers to be run with the
    `securityContext.privileged` flag set to true.
  rationale: >
    Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and
    devices. A container
    running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists
    to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices.
    There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
    privileged containers.
    If you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you
    should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and
    users are given permission to access that PSP.
  audit: |
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```
    For each PSP, check whether privileged is enabled:
    ```
    kubectl get psp -o json
    ```
    Verify that there is at least one PSP which does not return `true`.
    `kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.privileged}'`
  remediation: |
    Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
    `.spec.privileged` field is omitted or set to `false`.
  impact: >
    Pods defined with `spec.containers[].securityContext.privileged: true` will
    not be permitted.
  default_value: |
    By default, when you provision an EKS cluster, a pod security policy called
    eks.privileged is automatically created. The manifest for that policy appears below:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
    annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: privileged allows full unrestricted access to
    pod features,
    as if the PodSecurityPolicy controller was not enabled.
