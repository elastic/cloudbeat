  name: Enable audit Logs (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1
  description: |
    The audit logs are part of the EKS managed Kubernetes control plane logs
    that are managed by Amazon EKS. 
    Amazon EKS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a
    record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon EKS. CloudTrail
    captures all API calls for Amazon EKS as events. The calls captured include calls from the
    Amazon EKS console and code calls to the Amazon EKS API operations.
  rationale: |
    Exporting logs and metrics to a dedicated, persistent datastore such as
    CloudTrail ensures
    availability of audit data following a cluster security event, and provides a central location
    for analysis of log and metric data collated from multiple sources.

    Perform the following to determine if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions:
    **Via the Management Console**
    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the EKS console at
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks
    2. Click on Cluster Name of the cluster you are auditing
    3. Click Logging
    You will see Control Plane Logging info
    ```
    API Server Enabled/Disabled
    Audit Enabled/Disabled
    Authenticator Enabled/Disabled
    Controller Manager Enabled/Disabled 
    Scheduler Enabled/Disabled
    ```
    4. Ensure all 5 choices are set to Enabled

    Perform the following to determine if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions:
    **Via The Management Console**
    1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the EKS console at
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks
    2. Click on Cluster Name of the cluster you are auditing
    3. Click Logging
    4. Select Manage Logging from the button on the right hand side
    5. Toggle each selection to the Enabled position.
    6. Click Save Changes

    **Via CLI**
    ```
    aws --region "${REGION_CODE}" eks describe-cluster --name "${CLUSTER_NAME}" -
    -query 'cluster.logging.clusterLogging[?enabled==true].types
    ```
  impact: >
    Audit logs will be created on the master nodes, which will consume disk
    space. 
    Care should be taken to avoid generating too large volumes of log information as this could impact the
    available of the cluster nodes. S3 lifecycle features can be used to manage the accumulation
    and management of logs over time.
    See the following AWS resource for more information on these features:
    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html
  default_value: >
    By default, cluster control plane logs aren't sent to CloudWatch Logs. ...
    When you enable a log type, the logs are sent with a log verbosity level of 2 . 
    To enable or disable control plane
    logs with the console. Open the Amazon EKS console at
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters .
    Amazon EKS Information in CloudTrail CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when
    you create the account. When activity occurs in Amazon EKS, that activity is recorded in a
    CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in Event history.
