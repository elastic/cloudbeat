  name: Ensure Image Vulnerability Scanning using Amazon ECR image scanning or a third party provider (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1
  description: |
    Scan images being deployed to Amazon EKS for vulnerabilities.
  rationale: >
    Vulnerabilities in software packages can be exploited by hackers or
    malicious users to
    obtain unauthorized access to local cloud resources. Amazon ECR and other third party
    products allow images to be scanned for known vulnerabilities.
  audit: >
    Please follow AWS ECS or your 3rd party image scanning provider's guidelines
    for enabling Image Scanning.
  remediation: |
    To utilize AWS ECR for Image scanning please follow the steps below:
    To create a repository configured for scan on push (AWS CLI)
    ```
    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-
    configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE
    ```
    To edit the settings of an existing repository (AWS CLI)
    ```
    aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration --repository-name $REPO_NAME --
    image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE
    ```
    Use the following steps to start a manual image scan using the AWS Management Console.
    1. Open the Amazon ECR console at
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.
    2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.
    3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.
    4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to scan.
    5. On the Images page, select the image to scan and then choose Scan.
  impact: |
    If you are utilizing AWS ECR
    The following are common image scan failures. You can view errors like this in the Amazon
    ECR console by displaying the image details or through the API or AWS CLI by using the
    DescribeImageScanFindings API.
    UnsupportedImageError You may get an UnsupportedImageError error when attempting
    to scan an image that was built using an operating system that Amazon ECR doesn't
    support image scanning for. Amazon ECR supports package vulnerability scanning for
    major versions of Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Oracle Linux,
    Alpine, and RHEL Linux distributions. Amazon ECR does not support scanning images built
    from the Docker scratch image.
    An UNDEFINED severity level is returned You may receive a scan finding that has a severity
    level of UNDEFINED. The following are the common causes for this:
    The vulnerability was not assigned a priority by the CVE source.
    The vulnerability was assigned a priority that Amazon ECR did not recognize.
    To determine the severity and description of a vulnerability, you can view the CVE directly
    from the source.
  default_value: |
    Images are not scanned by Default.
