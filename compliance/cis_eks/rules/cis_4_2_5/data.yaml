  name: Minimize the admission of containers with allowPrivilegeEscalation (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1
  description: |
    Do not generally permit containers to be run with the
    `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to true.
  rationale: >
    A container running with the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to `true` may
    have
    processes that can gain more privileges than their parent.
    There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
    containers to allow privilege escalation. The option exists (and is defaulted to true) to
    permit setuid binaries to run.
    If you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation,
    this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to
    ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that
    PSP.
  audit: |
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```
    For each PSP, check whether privileged is enabled:
    ```
    kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation}'
    ```
    Verify that there is at least one PSP which does not return true.
  remediation: |
    Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
    `.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation` field is omitted or set to false.
  impact: >
    Pods defined with `spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` will not be permitted
    unless they are run under a specific PSP.
  default_value: |
    By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.
