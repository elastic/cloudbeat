  name: Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1
  description: |
    Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `hostNetwork` flag set
    to true.
  rationale: |
    A container running in the host's network namespace could access the local
    loopback
    device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods.
    There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit
    containers to share the host network namespace.
    If you have need to run containers which require hostNetwork, this should be defined in a
    separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited
    service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.
  audit: |
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```
    For each PSP, check whether privileged is enabled:
    ```
    kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.hostNetwork}'
    ```
    Verify that there is at least one PSP which does not return true.
  remediation: |
    Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
    `.spec.hostNetwork` field is omitted or set to false.
  impact: >
    Pods defined with `spec.hostNetwork: true` will not be permitted unless they
    are run under a specific PSP.
  default_value: |
    By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.
