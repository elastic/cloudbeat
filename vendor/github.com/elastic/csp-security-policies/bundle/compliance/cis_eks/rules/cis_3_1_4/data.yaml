  name: Ensure that the kubelet configuration file ownership is set to root:root (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1
  description: |
    Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config`
    argument, that file is owned by `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a
    config file
    specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file
    permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the
    administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    First, SSH to the relevant worker node:
    To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status kubelet
    ```
    The output should return `Active: active (running) since..`
    Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate Kubelet config file:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    The output of the above command should return something similar to `--config`
    `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` which is the location of the Kubelet
    config file.
    Run the following command:
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json
    ```
    The output of the above command is the Kubelet config file's ownership. Verify that the
    ownership is set to `root:root`
  remediation: |
    Run the following command (using the config file location identified in the
    Audit step)
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json
    ```
