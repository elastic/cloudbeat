  name: Ensure that the --kubeconfig kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    • Level 1 - Worker Node
  description: |
    Ensure that the kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root.
  rationale: >
    The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters

    that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to

    maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root.
  audit: >
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable for the / of

    the kubelet config file.

    Please set $kubelet_config= based on the file location on your system

    for example:

    `export kubelet_config=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`

    To perform the audit manually:

    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker

    node. For example,
    ```
    stat -c %U %G /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: >
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    
    each worker node. For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kubelet.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
