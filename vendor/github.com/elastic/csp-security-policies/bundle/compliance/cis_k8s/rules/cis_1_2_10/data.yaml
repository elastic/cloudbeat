  description: |
    Limit the rate at which the API server accepts requests.
  rationale: >
    Using `EventRateLimit` admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the

    API Server will accept in a given time slice. A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and

    DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant

    cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have

    a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to

    limit the rate of events that the API server will accept.

    Note: This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release.
  audit: >
    Run the following command on the Control Plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `EventRateLimit`.
  remediation: >
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a
    configuration file.

    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    
    and set the below parameters.
    ```
    --enable-admission-plugins=...,EventRateLimit,...

    --admission-control-config-file=<path/to/configuration/file>
    ```
  impact: |
    You need to carefully tune in limits as per your environment.
  default_value: |
    By default, `EventRateLimit` is not set.
