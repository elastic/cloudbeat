  name: Ensure that the --kubelet-client-certificate and
    --kubelet-client-keyarguments are set as appropriate (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Enable certificate based kubelet authentication.
  rationale: >
    The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet's
    HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously.
    You should set up certificate- based kubelet authentication to ensure that
    the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--kubelet-client-certificate` and `--kubelet-client-key` arguments
    exist and they are set as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between
    the
    apiserver and kubelets. Then, edit API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the control plane node and set the
    kubelet client certificate and key parameters as below.
    ```
    --kubelet-client-certificate=<path/to/client-certificate-file>
    --kubelet-client-key=<path/to/client-key-file>
    ```
  impact: |
    You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
  default_value: |
    By default, certificate-based kubelet authentication is not set.
