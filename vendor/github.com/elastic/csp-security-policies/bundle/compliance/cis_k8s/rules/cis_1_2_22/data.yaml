  name: Ensure that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as
    appropriate (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Rotate log files on reaching 100 MB or as appropriate.
  rationale: >
    Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files
    ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out
    any investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and
    the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB
    of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--audit-log-maxsize` argument is set to `100` or as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the `--audit-log-maxsize` parameter to an
    appropriate size in MB. For example, to set it as 100 MB:
    ```
    --audit-log-maxsize=100
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, auditing is not enabled.
