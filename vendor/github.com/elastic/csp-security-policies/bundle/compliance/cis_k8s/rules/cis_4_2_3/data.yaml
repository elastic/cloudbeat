  description: |
    Enable Kubelet authentication using certificates.
  rationale: >
    The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs
    for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the
    kubelet's port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the
    kubelet's HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the
    kubelet's serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to
    man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public
    networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the
    apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on each node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and is set to the location of the client
    certificate authority file.
    If the `--client-ca-file` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file
    specified by `--config`, and that the file sets `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the
    location of the client certificate authority file.
  remediation: |
    If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication:
    x509:clientCAFile` 
    to
    the location of the client CA file.
    If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
    `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and
    set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.
    ```
    --client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>
    ```
    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart kubelet.service
    ```
  impact: |
    You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.
