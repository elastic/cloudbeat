    Ensure that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate
    (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Retain the logs for at least 30 days or as appropriate.
  rationale: >
    Retaining logs for at least 30 days ensures that you can go back in time and
    investigate or
    correlate any events. Set your audit log retention period to 30 days or as per your business
    requirements.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--audit-log-maxage` argument is set to `30` or as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the `--audit-log-maxage` parameter to 30 or
    as an appropriate number of days:
    ```
    --audit-log-maxage=30
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, auditing is not enabled.
