    Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file ownership is set
    to root:root (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file ownership is set
    to `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The controller manager pod specification file controls various parameters
    that set the behavior of various components of the control plane node. You should
    set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file
    should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: >
    By default, `kube-controller-manager.yaml` file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
