  name: Ensure that the controller-manager.conf file ownership is set to root:root
  rule_number: 1.1.18
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: Ensure that the `controller-manager.conf` file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
  rationale: |-
    The `controller-manager.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Controller Manager.
    You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```

    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: |
    By default, `controller-manager.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
