  name: Ensure that the --peer-auto-tls argument is not set to true (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Do not use automatically generated self-signed certificates for TLS
    connections between peers.
  rationale: >
    etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments
    for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are
    sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd
    peers in the etcd cluster. Hence, do not use self- signed certificates for
    authentication.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the etcd server node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep etcd
    ```
    Verify that if the `--peer-auto-tls` argument exists, it is not set to `true`.
    **Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you are using only one
    etcd server in your environment then this recommendation is not applicable.
  remediation: |
    Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`
    on
    the control plane
    node and either remove the `--peer-auto-tls` parameter or set it to `false`.
    ```
    --peer-auto-tls=false
    ```
  impact: >
    All peers attempting to communicate with the etcd server will require a
    valid client certificate for authentication.
  default_value: |
    **Note:** This recommendation is applicable only for etcd clusters. If you
    are using only one etcd server in your environment then this recommendation
    is not applicable. By default, `--peer-auto-tls` argument is set to `false`.
