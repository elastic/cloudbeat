  name: Ensure that the kubelet --config configuration file ownership is set to
    root:root (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Worker Node
  description: >
    Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the
    `--config` argument, that file is owned by root:root.
  rationale: >
    The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a
    config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified
    you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the
    file. The file should be owned by root:root.
  audit: |
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a
    variable
    for the / of
    the kubelet config yaml file.
    Please set $kubelet_config_yaml= based on the file location on your system
    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_config_yaml=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
    ```
    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
    node. For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the
    Audit step)
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: >
    By default, `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` file as set up by `kubeadm` is
    owned by
    `root:root`.
