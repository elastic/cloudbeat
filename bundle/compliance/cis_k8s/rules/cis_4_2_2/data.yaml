  name: Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow
    (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Worker Node
  description: |
    Do not allow all requests. Enable explicit authorization.
  rationale: >
    Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones)
    without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should
    restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on each node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    If the `--authorization-mode` argument is present check that it is not set to `AlwaysAllow`. If
    it is not present check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that file
    sets `authorization: mode` to something other than `AlwaysAllow`.
    It is also possible to review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the `/configz`
    endpoint on the Kubelet API port (typically `10250/TCP`). Accessing these with appropriate
    credentials will provide details of the Kubelet's configuration.
  remediation: |
    If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authorization: mode`
    to
    `Webhook`.
    If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file
    `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` on each worker node and
    set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.
    ```
    --authorization-mode=Webhook
    ```
    Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:
    ```
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl restart kubelet.service
    ```
  impact: |
    Unauthorized requests will be denied.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--authorization-mode` argument is set to `AlwaysAllow`.
