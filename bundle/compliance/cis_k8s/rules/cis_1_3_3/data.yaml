    Ensure that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true
    (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Use individual service account credentials for each controller.
  rationale: >
    The controller manager creates a service account per controller in the
    `kube-system` namespace, generates a credential for it, and builds a
    dedicated API client with that service account credential for each
    controller loop to use. Setting the `--use-service-account-credentials`  to
    true runs each control loop within the controller manager using a separate
    service account credential. When used in combination with RBAC, this ensures
    that the control loops run with the minimum permissions required to perform
    their intended tasks.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
    ```
    Verify that the `--use-service-account-credentials` argument is set to `true`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` 
    on the control plane node to set the below parameter.
    ```
    --use-service-account-credentials=true
    ```
  impact: >
    Whatever authorizer is configured for the cluster, it must grant sufficient
    permissions to the service accounts to perform their intended tasks. When
    using the RBAC authorizer, those roles are created and bound to the
    appropriate service accounts in the `kube-system` namespace automatically
    with default roles and rolebindings that are auto-reconciled on startup. If
    using other authorization methods (ABAC, Webhook, etc), the cluster deployer
    is responsible for granting appropriate permissions to the service accounts
    (the required permissions can be seen by inspecting the
    `controller-roles.yaml` and `controller-role-bindings.yaml` files for the
    RBAC roles.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--use-service-account-credentials` is set to false.
