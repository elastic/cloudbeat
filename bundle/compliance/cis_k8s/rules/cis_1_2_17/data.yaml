  name: Ensure that the --secure-port argument is not set to 0 (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not disable the secure port.
  rationale: >
    The secure port is used to serve https with authentication and
    authorization. If you disable it, no https traffic is served and all traffic
    is served unencrypted.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--secure-port` argument is either not set or is set to an integer value
    between 1 and 65535.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and either remove the `--secure-port` parameter or
    set it to a different (non-zero) desired port.
  impact: |
    You need to set the API Server up with the right TLS certificates.
  default_value: |
    By default, port 6443 is used as the secure port.
