    Ensure that the controller-manager.conf file permissions are set to 644 or
    more restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the `controller-manager.conf` file has permissions of `644` or
    more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The `controller-manager.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Controller
    Manager. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity
    of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the
    system.
  audit: |
    Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `controller-manager.conf` has permissions of `640`.
