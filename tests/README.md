# Cloudbeat Automated Tests Framework (C-ATF)
>

This project provides an ability to develop component and integration tests for Cloudbeat.


## Getting started

This guide provides installations for macOS users via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
For other platforms, please go forward through instructions provided in links and select relevant installation:

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)


3. Install [JUST](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner

```shell
brew install just
```

After installing just you will be able to execute commands defined in **JUSTFILE** located in the project root folder.

4. Install [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start)

```shell
brew install kind
```
After installing kind you will be able to create and run local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container.

5. Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

```
brew install helm
```
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

6. Install [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline) commandline tool

```shell
brew install allure
```
After install allure commandline you will be able to display raw test results in pretty html format.

## System Under Test (SUT) Setup

Before performing steps below verify that **just** tool is installed and your root folder in commandline is cloudbeat.
1. Create Kubernetes cluster
```shell
just create-kind-cluster
```
This command will create new kubernetes cluster named **kind-mono**.
In order to verify that cluster installed you can execute:
```shell
kind get clusters
```

2. Build cloudbeat and upload docker image to kind
```shell
just build-cloudbeat
just load-cloudbeat-image
```

3. Install elasticsearch and start cloudbeat
```shell
just deploy-tests-helm-ci pre_merge
```
This command will install elasticsearch 8.5.0 one node instance in kubernetes cluster and prepare configuration
for executing **pre_merge** marker tests.


## Developing Tests

### Built With

Automated test framework is built on top of the following:
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) - mature full-featured Python testing framework.
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) - tool for dependency **management** and **packaging** in Python.
- [allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_pytest) - test report tool and framework that generates html reports, and allow everyone to participate in the development process to extract maximum of useful information from tests.

### Prerequisites

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) python package manager
```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```
**Note**: Installing poetry process will also initiate python installation if not installed yet.

### Setting up Dev

In the github, fork [cloudbeat repo](https://github.com/elastic/cloudbeat). After forking the repo, clone and install dependencies.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/cloudbeat.git
cd cloudbeat/tests
poetry install
```
### Configuring IDE

Tests development may be done using any IDE like [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
#### Configure Interpreter
Pycharm has integration with poetry therefore in order to use it as interpreter perform the following:
- Navigate to PyCharm -> Preferences...
- Write **Python interpreter** in the search box
- Select Gear icon near Python interpreter text box
- Select Poetry environment

#### Tests Project as Root
Since this test project is a standalone project in cloudbeat repo, in pycharm you can configure it as standalone repo:

- PyCharm -> Preferences...
- Write **Project Structure** in the search box
- Select tests folder as content root

#### Run / Debug Configuration:
- Open Run/Debug Configuration dialog
- Select pytest as runner
- For target select script path radio button and select script to be executed
- In Additional arguments define: -s -v --alluredir=./reports
- In Python interpreter select Poetry

### Project Structure

The project main folders are:
- commonlib - contains helper functions used for tests development.
- deploy -  contains helm charts for deploying ELK, cloudbeat, and tests docker.
- product - contains cloudbeat tests, for example cloudbeat behavior and functional tests.
- integration - contains cloudbeat integration tests.
- project root content - contains project and tests configuration files.

### Adding New Tests

#### Conventions

- Test file shall start with **test_** prefix, for example test_login.py.
- Test method shall start with **test_** prefix, for example test_login_success().
- Add test marker for a test method. Framework markers are defined in **pyproject.toml** file, section **[tool.pytest.ini_options] markers**
- SetUp and TearDown actions for a test method are defined using pytest.fixture.
- Global SetUp and TearDown actions are defined in **conftest.py** file.


#### Test Folders

- Product tests folder is **product/tests**.</br>
- Integration tests folder is **intergration/tests**.



### Building

Test framework output is a docker image that encapsulates python framework and tests.
In order to build tests docker image ensure that docker desktop application is running.

```shell
cd tests
docker build -t cloudbeat-tests .
```
The command above will build docker image tagged as **cloudbeat-tests**, '.' - means search for **Dockerfile** in the current folder.

Execute the following command
```shell
docker images
```
The cloudbeat-tests:latest image shall appear in docker images list.

### Uploading Image

For loading test's docker image to kind cluster execute
```shell
just load-pytest-kind
```

## Tests Execution

Tests execution depends on the developers needs and currently this framework supports the following modes:
1. Dev Mode - Writing test and executing tests on dev machine
2. Integration Mode (Production) - Writing tests on dev machine, building test's docker image, and executing tests in kubernetes cluster.

### Dev Mode

To run all test targets with just cloudbeat, without testing against Kibana or Elasticsearch, run

```
just run-test-targets
```

Note that this will create and destroy the test cluster several times. Logs can be found in the `test-logs` directory and test results can be found in `tests/allure/results`.

----

Before running tests verify that **System Under Test (SUT) Setup** is done and running.
Since elasticsearch is deployed inside cluster, for reaching it from outside execute the following command:
```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/elasticsearch-master -n kube-system 9200
```
For kibana:
```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/cloudbeat-test-kibana -n kube-system 5601
```
IDE: Execute tests by IDE runner (assume run/debug setup done before) -> click on play/debug button
Terminal: Ensure that virtualenv is activated and then execute
```shell
poetry run pytest -s -v -m ci_cloudbeat --alluredir=./reports
allure serve ./reports
```

### Integration Mode

1. Build tests docker image and upload to kubernetes cluster
```shell
just build-test-docker
just load-tests-image-kind
```
2. If **SUT** is not deployed initiate:
```shell
just deploy-tests-helm-ci pre_merge
```
3. Execute tests
```shell
just run-tests
```
4. Investigate reports
```shell
allure serve <path to raw result data>
```

## CI-CD Workflows

Current usage of test project is in the following ci flows:
- cloudbeat-ci
  - build cloudbeat-tests docker image
  - load cloudbeat-tests docker image to kind cluster
  - deploy tests helm chart
  - execute product and integration cloudbeat tests

## EKS Functional Tests

The verification results are based on pre-defined configuration of EKS clusters.
In order to be able to cover all test cases need to execute eks related tests on the following clusters
- test-eks-config-1
- test-eks-config-2

Environment variable EKS_CONFIG is used by framework to identify which test cases to execute.

### Tests Execution

EKS test markers are defined in pyproject.toml
- eks_file_system_rules
- eks_process_rules
- eks_k8s_objects_rules
- eks_aws_service_rules

Tests execution may be done by selecting appropriate marker.

#### Kubernetes Objects Tests

Kubernetes objects findings are not dependent on cluster configuration and may be executed in any EKS cluster.
Before tests execution ensure that the following pods are running:
- test-eks-good-pod
- test-eks-bad-pod

Pods definition location:
- [test-eks-good-pod](./deploy/eks-psp-pass-pod.yaml)
- [test-eks-bad-pod](./deploy/eks-psp-failures-pod.yaml)

Pods are identified by label `testResourceId`.
