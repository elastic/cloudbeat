# Cloudbeat Automated Tests Framework (C-ATF)

>

>

This project provides a framework for developing component and integration tests for Cloudbeat.

## Getting started

This guide provides installations for macOS users via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
For other platforms, please go forward through instructions provided in links and select relevant installation:

Install [Allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_installing_a_commandline) commandline tool

```shell
brew install allure
```

After install allure commandline you will be able to display raw test results in pretty html format.

## System Under Test (SUT) Setup

Before performing steps below verify that **just** tool is installed and your root folder in commandline is cloudbeat.

1. Create Kubernetes cluster

    ```shell
    just create-kind-cluster
    ```

2. Build cloudbeat and upload docker image to kind

    ```shell
    just build-cloudbeat-docker-image
    just load-cloudbeat-image
    ```

3. Install elasticsearch and start cloudbeat

    ```shell
    just deploy-tests-helm pre_merge values_file='tests/deploy/values/ci.yml' range=''
    ```

This command will install elasticsearch one node instance in kubernetes cluster and prepare configuration
for executing **pre_merge** marker tests.

### Dependencies

Automated test framework is built on top of the following:

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) -  Python testing framework.
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) - Dependency management for Python.
- [allure](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_pytest) - Generates html test reports.

### Prerequisites

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) python package manager

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

**Note**: Installing poetry process will also initiate python installation if not installed yet.

### Setting up Dev

After forking the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/cloudbeat.git
cd cloudbeat/tests
poetry install
```

### Configuring IDE

Tests development may be done using any IDE like [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
or [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

#### Configure Interpreter

Pycharm has integration with poetry. We recommend using it as interpreter for tests development:

- Navigate to PyCharm -> Preferences -> Project -> Project Interpreter
- Select Gear icon near Python interpreter text box
- Select Poetry environment

#### Tests Project as Root

Since this test project is a standalone project in cloudbeat repo, in pycharm you can configure it as standalone repo:

- PyCharm -> Preferences -> Project -> Project Structure
- Write **Project Structure** in the search box
- Select tests folder as content root

or alternatively, right-click the tests folder and select **Mark Directory as** -> **Sources Root**

#### Run / Debug Configuration:

- Open Run/Debug Configuration dialog
- Select pytest as runner
- For target select script path radio button and select script to be executed
- In Additional arguments define: -s -v --alluredir=./reports
- In Python interpreter select Poetry

### Project Structure

The project main folders are:

- commonlib - contains helper functions used for tests development.
- deploy - contains helm charts for deploying ELK, cloudbeat, and tests docker.
- product - contains cloudbeat tests, for example cloudbeat behavior and functional tests.
- integration - contains cloudbeat integration tests.
- project root content - contains project and tests configuration files.

### Adding New Tests

#### Conventions

- Test file shall start with **test_** prefix, for example test_login.py.
- Test method shall start with **test_** prefix, for example test_login_success().
- Add test marker for a test method. Framework markers are defined in **pyproject.toml** file,
  section **[tool.pytest.ini_options] markers**
- SetUp and TearDown actions for a test method are defined using pytest.fixture.
- Global SetUp and TearDown actions are defined in **conftest.py** file.

#### Test Folders

- Product tests folder is **product/tests**.</br>
- Integration tests folder is **intergration/tests**.

#### Logging

This project uses [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) for logging.
To start logging, just import logger from loguru lib
```shell
from loguru import logger

logger.info("Start logging")
```

Basic logging configuration is realized through [environment variables](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru/blob/master/loguru/_defaults.py)

Additional functionality
- **caplog fixture** - add a sink that propagates Loguru to the caplog handler.
- **logger_wraps** - useful to log entry and exit values of a function

### CSPM Functional Tests

CSPM functional tests are designed to check CSPM rules behaviour.

The tests are located under [product folder](./product/tests).

Test file identification prefix: `test_aws_`

CSPM tests are grouped by:
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Identification And Management (IAM)
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Relation Database Service (RDS)
- Simple Storage Service (S3)
- Networking (VPC)

For example `EC2` rules will be located under `test_aws_ec2_rules.py`

Parametrization is used to separate and simplify the test development process.

The test file defines logic of the test, and the data file defines test cases.

AWS tests data is located in [aws folder](./product/tests/data/aws).

Data file identification prefix: `aws_`

For example `EC2` data cases will be located under `aws_ec2_test_cases.py`.

#### Adding new CSPM test

- Define data manually in AWS Cloud and define / get property for resource unique identification
- Create test case data in `data` folder, for example in file `aws_logging_test_cases.py`
```python
cis_aws_log_3_1_pass = EksAwsServiceCase(
    rule_tag=CIS_3_1,
    case_identifier="cloudtrail-704479110758", # resource unique identifier
    expected=RULE_PASS_STATUS,
)
```
- Update the test cases dictionary or create a new one if it didn't exist, for example:
```python
cis_aws_log_3_1 = {
    "3.1 Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions expect: passed": cis_aws_log_3_1_pass,
}
```
- Finally, reference created dictionary in the group of all test cases, for example
```python
cis_aws_log_cases = {
    **cis_aws_log_3_1,
    ...
```
- If just adding a new test case to existing test suite, no additional steps are required, the case will be added automatically
- For new test suite create a test file in [product folder](./product/tests), like `test_aws_logging_rules.py`
- Implement test method or just copy from any `test_aws_` and updated accordingly data section
```python
register_params(
    test_aws_logging_rules, # should be updated
    Parameters(
        ("rule_tag", "case_identifier", "expected"),
        [*aws_logging_tc.cis_aws_log_cases.values()], # should be replaced by new data
        ids=[*aws_logging_tc.cis_aws_log_cases.keys()], # should be replaced by new data
    ),
)
```
- Define new marker, for example
```python
@pytest.mark.aws_logging_rules # <-- new marker should be created
def test_aws_logging_rules(
    elastic_client,
    cloudbeat_agent,
```

- Update markers section in `pyproject.toml` with newly created marker
```python
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
markers = [
    "pre_merge",
    "pre_merge_agent",
    ... # <-- add new marker
```

- Execute the test suite by running the following command and replacing marker `aws_logging_rules` with newly defined marker
```shell
poetry run pytest -m "aws_logging_rules" --alluredir=./allure/results/ --clean-alluredir
```

### Building

Test framework output is a docker image that encapsulates python framework and tests.
In order to build tests docker image ensure that docker desktop application is running.

```shell
cd tests
docker build -t cloudbeat-tests .
```

The command above will build docker image tagged as **cloudbeat-tests**, '.' - means search for **Dockerfile** in the
current folder.

Execute the following command

```shell
docker images
```

The cloudbeat-tests:latest image shall appear in docker images list.

### Uploading Image

For loading test's docker image to kind cluster execute

```shell
just load-pytest-kind
```

## Tests Execution

Tests execution depends on the developers needs and currently this framework supports the following modes:

1. Dev Mode - Writing test and executing tests on dev machine
2. Integration Mode (Production) - Writing tests on dev machine, building test's docker image, and executing tests in
   kubernetes cluster.

### Dev Mode

To run all test targets with just cloudbeat, without testing against Kibana or Elasticsearch, run

```
just run-test-targets
```

Note that this will create and destroy the test cluster several times. Logs can be found in the `test-logs` directory
and test results can be found in `tests/allure/results`.

----

Before running tests verify that **System Under Test (SUT) Setup** is done and running.
Since elasticsearch is deployed inside cluster, for reaching it from outside execute the following command:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/elasticsearch-master -n kube-system 9200
```

For kibana:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/cloudbeat-test-kibana -n kube-system 5601
```

IDE: Execute tests by IDE runner (assume run/debug setup done before) -> click on play/debug button
Terminal: Ensure that virtualenv is activated and then execute

```shell
poetry run pytest -s -v -m ci_cloudbeat --alluredir=./reports
allure serve ./reports
```

### Integration Mode

1. Build tests docker image and upload to kubernetes cluster

    ```shell
    just build-test-docker
    just load-tests-image-kind```


2. If test suite is not deployed initiate:

    ```shell
    just deploy-tests-helm pre_merge
    ```
3. Execute tests

    ```shell
    just run-tests
    ```

4. Investigate reports

    ```shell
    allure serve <path to raw result data>
    ```

## CI-CD Workflows

Current usage of test project is in the following ci flows:

- cloudbeat-ci
    - build cloudbeat-tests docker image
    - load cloudbeat-tests docker image to kind cluster
    - deploy tests helm chart
    - execute product and integration cloudbeat tests

## EKS Functional Tests

The verification results are based on pre-defined configuration of EKS clusters.
In order to be able to cover all test cases need to execute eks related tests on the following clusters

- test-eks-config-1
- test-eks-config-2

Environment variable EKS_CONFIG is used by framework to identify which test cases to execute.

### Tests Execution

EKS test markers are defined in pyproject.toml

- eks_file_system_rules
- eks_process_rules
- eks_k8s_objects_rules
- eks_aws_service_rules

Tests execution may be done by selecting appropriate marker.

#### Kubernetes Objects Tests

Kubernetes objects findings are not dependent on cluster configuration and may be executed in any EKS cluster.
Before tests execution ensure that the following pods are running:

- test-eks-good-pod
- test-eks-bad-pod

Pods definition location:

- [test-eks-good-pod](deploy/eks-psp-pass-pod.yaml)
- [test-eks-bad-pod](deploy/eks-psp-failures-pod.yaml)

Pods are identified by label `testResourceId`.
