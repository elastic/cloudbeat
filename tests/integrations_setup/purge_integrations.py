Purge Integrations and Policies

This script is used to purge integrations and policies
based on the stored IDs in the state_data.json file.

The following steps are performed:
1. Read the package policy IDs and agent policy IDs from the state_data.json file.
2. Delete the package policies and agent policies based on the stored IDs.
3. Delete the state_data.json file.

Usage:
    python purge_integrations.py
